## Yeah, Interpreters are everywhere
it's more a branch of compsci than a design pattern

Motivation:
- Process structured textual input into "something"
- I mean come-one, interpreters!
- Literally evertwhere dawg

Formally:
__Interpreter__ : A component that processes structures text data. Does so by turning it into separate lexical tokens (lexing) and then interpreting sequences of said tokens (parsing)


Aside:
- Use boost-spirit to build an efficient parser easily
